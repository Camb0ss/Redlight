# Redlight
Log Bot For "ARK: Survival Evolved"  
  
  An application written in Python to monitor the status of "Tribe Logs"   
  in game while not requiring the game window to actually be active.
    
# Example
With "ARK: Survival Evolved" running in the background, you are able to play other games/browse  
while keeping logs completely covered.
      
# Installation/Setup
  Install the 64bit version  
  https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki  
    
  After Tesseract installs, you will have to set up your Discord Webhooks (2-3)  
    A Guide on how to set those up.  
    https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks  
      
  Once those are out of the way, you will have to get the "roleid" of the Roles that you want to ping in Discord  
    as well as the webhooks for the Redlight.ini
